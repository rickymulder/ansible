Ansible Playbooks/roles for Sensu and Spacewalk clients
=========

Both roles require very slight modification for use within your environment.  Please read through them prior to running either.  Spacewalk has been designed to work for either RHEL/CentOS 6/7, but it has only been tested for RHEL6.

--------------
Note: The spacewalk role is meant for registering older clients (<= 2.7).  It can easily be modified to newer clients by updating the RPM locations.
